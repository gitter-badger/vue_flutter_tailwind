### Flutter styled Vue3 with Tailwind CSS:

Flutter & Dart awesome!
Vue3 & Typescript & Tailwind awesome too!

The reason why this project have been started is a question:

Flutter is not working inside Excel:( and its kind of complicated to work with web libraries.

So, what if we will write Vue3 TS in style of Flutter, because it's just simplier and faster?

**Please notice:**

- It is not a Flutter at all and even close, but hopefully will be use its style of components & methods writing.
- It is not properly written at all and cannot be used in production until release 1.
- All is subject to change until release 1.
- If you like this project - contributing &|| star is very welcome and appreciated and will keep development running Open Source and free:)
