# Vue3 styled like Flutter with Tailwind CSS

**Tools:**

- Main inspiration, ideas from Flutter
- Vue3
- Typescript
- Tailwind

**The reason & motivation why this project have been started is a question:**
Flutter & Dart awesome!
Vue3 & Typescript & Tailwind awesome too!

But...

Flutter is not working inside Excel:( and its kind of complicated to work with web libraries.

So, what if we will write Vue3 TS in style of Flutter, because it's just simplier and faster?

**Please notice:**

- It is not a Flutter at all and even close, but hopefully will be use its style of components & methods writing.
- It is not properly written at all and cannot be used in production until release 1.
- All is subject to change until release 1.
- If you like this project - contributing &|| star is very welcome and appreciated and will keep development running Open Source and free:)

- [] Tailwind included as package, but needs to be included to main.ts(js) when this package added. Maybe it's a wrong way..
